ANSWER:-
1.Software Developer: Responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code. They translate design specifications into functional software, debug issues, and collaborate with other team members to ensure the software meets user requirements and performs well.

2.Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Focuses on ensuring the software is of high quality through rigorous testing. They design and execute test cases, identify and document defects, and work with developers to resolve issues, ensuring the software is reliable and meets the specified requirements.

3.Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. They coordinate tasks among team members, manage schedules and budgets, communicate with stakeholders, and ensure that the project meets deadlines and quality standards. They also handle risk management and ensure the project aligns with business goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
ANSWER:-
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are crucial in the software development process because they provide a comprehensive suite of tools within a single interface, facilitating efficient coding, debugging, and testing. IDEs often include features like code editors, syntax highlighting, code completion, and integrated debugging tools, which streamline the development workflow and improve productivity. Examples*: 

- Visual Studio: Offers a wide range of tools for developing applications in various languages, with robust debugging and testing features.
- IntelliJ IDEA: Known for its powerful code analysis, refactoring tools, and support for multiple programming languages.

Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential for managing changes to the codebase, facilitating collaboration among developers, and maintaining a history of code revisions. VCS allows teams to track changes, revert to previous versions, and resolve conflicts, which is critical for ensuring code integrity and supporting concurrent development. **Examples**:

- Git: A distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and provides features like branching and merging.
- Subversion (SVN): A centralized version control system that maintains a single repository for all changes, allowing for easier management of code versions and history.

Both IDEs and VCS are integral to modern software development, enhancing efficiency, collaboration, and code quality.
